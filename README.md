# TSF - The Sparks Foundation

I will be uploading the codes for each task completed under The Sparks Foundation Data Science and Analytics internship Aug - Sept 2020.

# Task 2 
10/08/2020

The task at hand was to use a linear regression model to predict the scores of students based on the amount of time they spent studying.

# Tast 3
21/08/2020

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# Task 4
21/08/2020

The purpose of this task was to create a Decision Tree Classifier, so that if any new data added, the model would be able to predict the right species based on the parameters.

In addition to creating a decision tree classifier, I created an app using Streamlit in which the viewer can input his/her own values for the parameters to determine the species. The code can be viewed in the iris_app.py file.
